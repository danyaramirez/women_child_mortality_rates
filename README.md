Introduction
This projects explores the connection between maternal mortality rates and newborn mortality rates with skilled health assistance at birth, and also with income inequality.

For this analysis, four indicators from the Gapminder World Dataset were selected:

Newborn Mortality Rate - deaths per 1,000 live births in the first 28 days from pregnancy termination
Maternal Mortality Ratio (IHME) - deaths per 100,000 live births within a year of pregnancy termination, due to a cause related to pregnancy or delivery
Gini Coefficient for Income Inequality - 0 to 1 (lower being "more equal")
Births Attended by Skilled Health Staff - percent of total deliveries attended by skilled health staff
The questions to be addressed in this analysis are as follows:

What countries have the highest and lowest maternal mortality rates in 2015?
How have maternal mortality rates changed over time worldwide?
How have maternal mortality rates changed in 26 years for each country?
Which countries have increased/decreased their maternal mortality rates?
What countries have the highest and lowest newborn mortality rates in 2015?
How have newborn mortality rates changed over time worldwide?
How have newborn mortality rates changed in 26 years for each country?
Which countries have increased/decreased their newborn mortality rates?
Are maternal mortality rates and newborn mortality rates correlated? How?
Are maternal mortality rates and newborn mortality rates correlated with income inequality? How?
Are maternal mortality rates and newborn mortality rates correlated with skilled health assistanc? How?

Note: "Skilled Health Staff" is defined as health personnel (doctors, nurses or midwives) trained in providing life-saving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, to conduct deliveries on their own, and to care for newborns.
